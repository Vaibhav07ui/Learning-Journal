## Week 4

This week's drawing was created using various tools in AutoCAD such as:

- Dimensions  
- Fillet  
- Center Mark  
- Polyline  
- Annotation  
- And more

A screenshot of the drawing is provided for quick viewing.  
If anyone wants to access the actual DWG file, they can download it and open it using AutoCAD.
