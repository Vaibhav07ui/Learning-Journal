# Week 7 â€“ 2D AutoCAD Drawing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This week, I worked on two separate mechanical components:  
- *Gear Arm*  
- *Form Roll Lever*

Both were completed as part of my ongoing AutoCAD 2D practice to improve precision, command usage, and layout management.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Commands Used
- Line, Circle, Arc, Polyline
- Offset, Trim, Extend
- Fillet (for smooth curved corners)
- Explode (to break down grouped objects)
- Annotation, Dimension (linear, radius, angle)
- Center Mark (for circular elements)

## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced
- Managing multiple parts in a single layout
- Applying accurate dimensions and annotations
- Using offsets and fillets to maintain part symmetry
- Visualizing mechanical parts before drawing
- Practicing layout clarity for readability
